## Abstract

Several open source tools are enabling the shift to cloud-native geospatial
Machine Learning workflows. Stream data from STAC APIs, generate Machine
Learning ready chips on-the-fly and train models for different downstream
tasks! Find out about advances in the Pangeo ML community towards scalable
GPU-native workflows.

### Long description

An overview of open source Python packages in the Pangeo (big data geoscience)
Machine Learning community will be presented. On read/write,
[kvikIO](https://github.com/rapidsai/kvikio) allows low-latency data transfers
from Zarr archives via NVIDIA GPU Direct Storage. With tensors loaded in xarray
data structures, [xbatcher](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/xbatcher) enables
efficient slicing of arrays in an iterative fashion. To connect the pieces,
[zen3geo](https://github.com/weiji14/zen3geo) acts as the glue between
geospatial libraries - from reading [STAC](https://stacspec.org) items and
rasterizing vector geometries to stacking multi-resolution datasets for custom
data pipelines. Learn more as the Pangeo community develops tutorials at
[Project Pythia](https://cookbooks.projectpythia.org), and join in to hear
about the challenges and ideas on scaling machine learning in the geosciences
with the [Pangeo ML Working Group](https://pangeo.io/meeting-notes.html#working-group-meetings).

# Getting started

## Installation

### NVIDIA GPU Direct Storage

Follow instructions at
https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#install-gpudirect-storage
to install NVIDIA GPU Direct Storage (GDS).

Verify that NVIDIA GDS has been installed properly following
https://docs.nvidia.com/gpudirect-storage/troubleshooting-guide/index.html#verify-suc-install.
E.g. if you are on Linux and have CUDA 12.2 installed, run:

    /usr/local/cuda-12.2/gds/tools/gdscheck.py -p

Alternatively, if you have your conda environment setup below, follow
https://xarray.dev/blog/xarray-kvikio#appendix-ii--making-sure-gds-is-working
and run:

    mamba activate foss4g2023oceania
    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapidsai/kvikio/branch-23.08/python/benchmarks/single-node-io.py | python

### Basic

To help out with development, start by cloning this [repo-url](/../../)

    git clone <repo-url>

Then I recommend [using mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
to install the dependencies.
A virtual environment will also be created with Python and
[JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) installed.

    cd foss4g2023oceania
    mamba env create --file environment.yml

Activate the virtual environment first.

    mamba activate foss4g2023oceania

Finally, double-check that the libraries have been installed.

    mamba list

### Advanced

This is for those who want full reproducibility of the virtual environment.
Create a virtual environment with just Python and conda-lock installed first.

    mamba create --name foss4g2023oceania python=3.10 conda-lock=2.3.0
    mamba activate foss4g2023oceania

Generate a unified [`conda-lock.yml`](https://github.com/conda/conda-lock) file
based on the dependency specification in `environment.yml`. Use only when
creating a new `conda-lock.yml` file or refreshing an existing one.

    conda-lock lock --mamba --file environment.yml --platform linux-64 --with-cuda=11.8

Installing/Updating a virtual environment from a lockile. Use this to sync your
dependencies to the exact versions in the `conda-lock.yml` file.

    conda-lock install --mamba --name foss4g2023oceania conda-lock.yml

See also https://conda.github.io/conda-lock/output/#unified-lockfile for more
usage details.

## Running the scripts

To create a subset of the WeatherBench2 Zarr dataset, run:

    python 0_weatherbench2zarr.py

This will save a one year subset of the WeatherBench2 ERA5 dataset at 6 hourly
resolution to your local disk (total size is about 18.2GB). It will include
data at pressure level 500hPa, with the variables 'geopotential',
'u_component_of_wind', and 'v_component_of_wind' only.

To run the benchmark experiment loading with the kvikIO engine, run:

    python 1_benchmark_kvikIOzarr.py

This will print out a progress bar showing the ERA5 data being loaded in
mini-batches (simulating a neural network training loop). One 'epoch' should
take under 15 seconds on an Ampere generation (e.g. RTX A2000) NVIDIA GPU. A
total of ten epochs will be ran, and the total time taken will be reported, as
well as the median/mean/standard deviation time taken per epoch.

To compare the benchmark results between the `kvikio` and `zarr` engines, do
the following:

1. Run `jupyter lab` to launch a JupyterLab session
2. In your browser, open the `2_compare_results.ipynb` notebook in JupyterLab
3. Run all the cells in the notebook

The time to load the ERA5 subset data using the `kvikio` and `zarr` engines
will be printed out. There will also be a summary report of the relative
speedup between the CPU-based `zarr` and GPU-based `kvikio` engine, and bar
plots of the absolute time taken for each backend engine.
